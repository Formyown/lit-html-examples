# Lit-html examples
Repository with examples and design patterns for building web components using the LitElement base class, and rendering templates using lit-html.

# Frequently asked questions
People starting with LitElement, especially those coming from PolymerElement, often have these questions:
* How to set default properties
* How to handle conditional logic (dom-if from PolymerElement)
* How to repeat templates (dom-repeat from PolymerElement)
* How to compute properties (computed properties from PolymerElement)
* How to observe property changes (property observers from PolymerElement)

# Who is this for?
This repository is intended as a starting point for all people who want to write web components with LitElement. Some special sections are added for people migrating from PolymerElement.

# Note
This project is a community effort. The authors of this repository are not affiliated with Google or the Polymer team. Because LitElement and lit-html are still in early stages of development, best practices and examples will change and evolve over time.

Contributions are appreciated, feel free to submit issues and PRs.
